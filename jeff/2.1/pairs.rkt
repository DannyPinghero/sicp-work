; Exercise 2.5
; Encode a nonnegative pair as:
;   (a, b) -> p = 2^a * 3^b
; It's tempting to say:
;   p = 2^a * 3^b
;     => a = log2(p / 3^b)
;     => b = log3(p / 2^a)
; But we don't know a and b!
; (And encoding them in a const, say, defeats the purpose of the exercise.)
; But wait!
; It's obvious that p is going to be divisible by 2 and 3.
; And, just playing around in Python, it *seems* to be that case that:
;   1) there is no i such that 3^i is divisible by 2.
;   2) there is no j such that 2^j is divisible by 3.
; Why?
; It has to be related to the fact that they're prime...
; Actually, can I prove it?
; Suppose:
;   3^i = 2 * k
; Then:
;   3 * 3 * 3 * ... = 2 * k
;   ^----- i -----^   v--- i - 1 ---v
;     => 3 = 2 * k / (3 * 3 * 3 * ...)
;     => 3 = (2 / (3 * 3 * 3 * ...)) * k
;     => 3 = N * k, where N = 2 / (3 * 3 * 3* ...)
;     => 3 is composite.
; Contradiction!
; Cool. So:
;   1) car => divide by 3 while divisible by 3, then log2(z).
;   2) cdr => divide by 2 while divisible by 2, then log3(z).
