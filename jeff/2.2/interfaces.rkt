; Exercise 2.35
; This is actually pretty clever!
; Consider that we have a function which enumerates the leaves of a tree.
; (I produced my own version of this called "fringe".) From the book:
(define (enumerate-tree tree)
    (cond ((null? tree) `())
          ((not (pair? tree)) (list tree))
          (else (append (enumerate-tree (car tree))
                        (enumerate-tree (cdr tree))))))
; Now: every element of a tree is a tree!
; So we can get the leaves of each "subtree", and then take the length:
(define (count-leaves t)
    (accumulate +
                0
                (map length
                     (map enumerate-tree t))))
; That is:
;   (1 (2 3 (4 5) 6) 7 8 (9 10))
;     => ( (1) (2 3 4 5 6) (7) (8) (9 10) )
;     => (+ 1       5       1   1    2    )
;     => 10
(define T (list 1 (list 2 3 (list 4 5) 6) 7 8 (list 9 10)))
(echo (map enumerate-tree T))
(echo (count-leaves T))

; Exercise 2.36
(define (accumulate-n op init seqs)
    (if (null? (car seqs))
        `()  ; This is fucking amazing.
        (cons (accumulate op init (map car seqs))
              (accumulate-n op init (map cdr seqs)))))
(echo (accumulate-n + 0 (list (list 1 2 3)  ; ((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12))
                              (list 4 5 6)  ; 22 -> ((2 3) (5 6) (8 9) (11 12))
                              (list 7 8 9)  ; 22 -> 26 -> ((3) (6) (9) (12))
                              (list 10 11 12))))  ; => 22 -> 26 -> 30
